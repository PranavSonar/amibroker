//    Amibroker does support both, RSI and RelStrength as shown by the syntax below.

    RSI (relative strength index);
    RSI( periods = 14 );
    RSIa( array, periods = 14 );

    RelStrength (comparative relative strength);
    RelStrength( "tickername", fixup = 1);
     

//The formula is simple: You need the following variables:
//The average of price change in percentiles for the last..:
//3 month period (A%)
//6 month period (B%)
//9 month period (C%)
//12 month period (D%)
//
//Then you need to put two times more weight for the A variable.
//
//Formula:
//40 * A% + 20 * B% + 20 * C% + 20 * D% - 100% = the basis of rank calculation for the relative strength of the stock.
//
//And then you need a tool to rank al the results from the stock universe against 
//each other and give the best performance a 100% reading and the worst a 0% reading. 
//All this can be done in microsoft excel... 
//RS = (40% * Tổng % 3 tháng) + (20% * tổng % 9 tháng) + (20%*tổng % 6 tháng) + (20%* tổng % 12 tháng)
